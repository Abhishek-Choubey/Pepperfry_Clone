Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Github
Media query
Roles and Responsibilities:
Day 1:
We started by going through the website, studying its design, layouts, content, etc.
There were many pages and functions in the website, but due to a shortage of time, we decided to go for the main page and its product pages including (features, pricing, sign in, sign-up followed the main page itself)
We started to go with the main page first. We split the main page into six parts from header to footer.
4. Aniket worked on the top section, Prashant worked on the Home page, Abishek worked on the Our Categories section, Sammith worked on payment Now part, Vishnu worked on wishlist and cart section.
5. So as we all were in touch with each other through Zoom and worked as per our plan, we were able to complete the main page layout on day 1 itself.
Day 2 :
This day, we planned to assign each one of us with the product, sign in, payment, cart pages.
At the end of the day, we were able to complete the product pages and tried working on the Git hub to push our files into the repository.


Day 3:
We planned to go for more features like Sign in, Signup, Whish list , Cart, Product page and the final payment page. It was a bit lengthy process as we have to work on the functionalities using Javascript.
Prasanth worked on the sign in and signup page, Abishek worked on the products page, Vishnu worked on the Cart page, Sammith worked on the Payment page.
Day 4:
We started working on the Media Queries part to improve the responsiveness of our website and added more functionalities.
we thought of wrapping the project, but the media query part dragged more time, so we took an entire day to do the media query part.

Day 5:
On this day, we worked on fixing the bugs and checked for the complete functionality of the project. Once we are satisfied with our part , we started pushing our part into the main repository and merged our files.
After completing our project, we have done a demo video for explaining the features and functionalities of our website.
Issues we faced:
We faced some issues in Git hub when we were trying to push and merge the files we created.
we were facing issues while pushing, merging files, looking after the conflicts, and creating branches.
Even this time, while making the pricing page we went through some alignment issues which cost us little time but in the end, we worked it out.
We were facing issues in media queries as these concepts are quite complicated to understand compared to HTML and CSS.
